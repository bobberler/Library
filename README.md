# Library
ICS4U Project

1.	The program should initially ask the user whether they are a librarian or a regular 
user/customer and then offer an appropriate menu of options for that type of user.
2.	The program should allow the librarian to:  add books to the library collection, remove books from the library collection, and modify any of the properties of a specific book. 
3.	The program should allow a regular user/customer to: examine the libraryâ€™s contents, search for a particular book based on any of its properties, borrow a book, and return a book.
4.	You should have the program save the contents to a file before it ends, and load the contents of the library at the beginning of the program.
